    <h1>Hi, I’m Rutvij. A doctor, researcher, and writer.</h1>
  </header>

    <section>
      <p>I’m a resident physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with interests in internal medicine, oncology, and healthcare delivery. My work brings together my background in medicine and social science, and I’m committed to advancing global healthcare delivery through clinical care, research, and education.</p>

      <p>Before residency, I was a medical student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I also hold an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where I studied healthcare delivery and health systems. I completed my undergraduate studies at Northwestern University where I studied Political Science and Economics.</p>

      <p>Outside work, I’m into sport, hiking, wildlife conservation, reading fiction, and overpriced coffee. I also love reading about political theory and political economy, particularly in the Indian context, and like writing short essays—often about politics, sport, or wildlife. You can find some of that writing under the <strong>Writing</strong> section on this page.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My interests span two intersecting areas:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Designing and building innovative care models</strong> that meet the needs of specific populations</li>
        <li><strong>Health system reform</strong>, with a particular focus on how financing mechanisms (like value-based care), state capacity, and socioeconomic determinants influence health</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>I was born in Mumbai, India and grew up primarily in Dubai, U.A.E. The header shows the view from the window in the living room of the family home in Breach Candy, Mumbai, where many ideas and dreams were conceived, discarded, or refined.</p>

      <p>I have lived in Mumbai, Dubai, Chicago, Toronto, Boston, and New York City. NYC is comfortably my favorite city among the above; it is a special place.</p>

      <p>Along the way, I spent two years as a healthcare consultant at Deloitte, contributed to global mental health research, interned at the WHO during the 2014–16 Ebola pandemic, and worked with the value-based care team at Mount Sinai to integrate behavioral health services with primary care.</p>

      <p>Home in the US is presently Boston, MA.</p>

      <p>‘Home in the world,’ to echo Amartya Sen’s memoirs but depart from them in spirit, is Mumbai.</p>
